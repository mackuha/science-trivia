# Science Trivia

Welcome to the Science Trivia Web App â€“ a solo project developed as part of the Scrimba curriculum. This web application leverages the Open Trivia DB API to generate five science-related questions at the start of each game. It is built using Vite, React, Tailwind CSS, and incorporates Framer Motion for animations.


## Features

- **Trivia Questions:** The app fetches five science trivia questions from the Open Trivia DB API to start the game.
- **User Interaction:** Users can answer each question and receive instant feedback on their responses.
- **Score Tracking:** The app keeps track of the user's score throughout the game.
- **Responsive Design:** Provides a seamless experience across various devices.
- **Animations:** Framer Motion is used to add subtle animations and enhance the user interface.


## Technologies Used

- **Vite:** A fast development server and bundler.
- **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
- **Framer Motion:** A library for creating animations in React applications.
